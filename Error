es01    | [1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]

 tried this and it did take but it still doesn't start with the new value
vim /etc/sysctl/sysctl.conf
and added this to the bottom of the file and rebooted the server
vm.max_map_count = 262144



sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
